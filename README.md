# Learning Engineering 📚

A personal collection of **Markdown-based study guides** primarily focused on **technical interview preparation**, covering **Data Structures & Algorithms** and **System Design**.

While interview prep is the main goal, you’re welcome to use these notes for **learning, revision, or reference** in any context.

This repository is intentionally **not comprehensive**. It’s a living set of notes that I add to over time as I study and revisit core engineering concepts.

## 🧠 Purpose

- 🎯 Prepare for software engineering interviews
- 📖 Consolidate core CS and system design fundamentals
- 🔍 Serve as a quick reference for revision
- ✍️ Capture understanding at a point in time

Depth and coverage will vary by topic and evolve gradually.
